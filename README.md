   ## Golden Ratio Optimization

   ### Description
   The `GoldenRationOptimization` animation demonstrates the optimization process using the golden ratio search algorithm. The animation visualizes the steps involved in finding the minimum or maximum of a function using the golden section search method.
   
   ## Newton's 1D Optimization
   
   ### Description
   The `Newtons1DOptimization` animation visualizes the optimization process using Newton's method in one dimension. It demonstrates the iterative steps involved in finding the minimum of a function, updating the Taylor approximation, and visualizing the distance between points during the optimization process.
